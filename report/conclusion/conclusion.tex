  This section will present the conclusion of this project and will discuss possible further improvement in the project.\\  With this project, we tried to predict the number of views for Wikipedia pages, particularly the page titled "2002 FIFA World Cup". The main goal of this project was not to compete with the state of the art methods for web traffic forecasting but rather to try out the approach of using Echo State Network for this task. Although much work remains to be done and the predictions for longer prediction horizons have $NRMSE$  values greater than 1, this study shows that ESNs have potential for this task and thus through further improvement of the network setup and data preprocessing steps, the quality of prediction can be improved. This project is focused on the prediction of web traffic for one particular page. Therefore, one of our future works would be to train the network to make predictions of web traffic for other Wikipedia pages and possibly multiple Wikipedia pages using single ESNs  and even for pages from other websites. For this experiment, we have used the additional signals that are highly correlated to the main input signal. However, these highly correlated signals add very few information to the main input signal. Therefore in the future, we would like to find the right signal to add to the input such that it is neither too less nor too highly correlated to the main input signal.
