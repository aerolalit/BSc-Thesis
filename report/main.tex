  \section{Statement and Motivation of Research}

  This part should make clear which question, exactly, you are
  pursuing, and why your project is relevant/interesting. This is the
  place to cite relevant literature. Where does your project extend
  the state of the art? What weaknesses in known approaches do you
  hope to overcome? If you have carried out preliminary experiments,
  describe them here.

  This is the technical core of the thesis. Here you lay out your how
  you answered your research question, you specify your design of
  experiments or simulations, point out difficulties that you
  encountered, etc.

  (target size: 3-4 pages)

  \section{Evaluation of the Investigation}

  This section discusses criteria that are used to evaluate the
  research results. Make sure your results can be used to published
  research results, i.e., to the already known state-of-the-art.

  (target size: 1-3 page)

  \section{Conclusions}

  Summarize the main aspects and results of the research
  project. Provide an answer to the research questions stated earlier.
