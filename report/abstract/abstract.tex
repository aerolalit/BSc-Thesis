  \newpage  \section*{Abstract}  Information about the potential web traffic that any particular website might receive in the future is essential for managing the server resources of the website. Similarly, network anomalies can be detected by comparing the real traffic with the values predicted by forecasting algorithm.  Online advertisers also rely on the predicted web traffic for making their advertisement related decisions. Therefore, anticipation of web traffic is important and has been carried out through various methods. Methods that have been previously used for this task are computationally expensive and have multiple problems. Neural Network approach, for instance, easily plunges into local optimum and has a complicated learning process leading to relatively slow calculating speed. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a type of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), with an easy to implement algorithm, that have achieved good results in a variety of tasks.  This paper evaluates the performance of ESN for the web traffic prediction task.
%   This paper presents how ESN can be used for web traffic prediction task. The are many parameters that need to be tuned and various data preprocessing techniques that need to be followed to obtain good results for the prediction. This paper explains how this is done.
