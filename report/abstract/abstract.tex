  \section*{Abstract}    Consider this a separate document, although it is submitted together  with the rest. The abstract aims at another audience than the rest  of the proposal. It is directed at the final decision maker or  generalist, who typically is not an expert at all in your field, but  more a manager kind of person. Thus, don't go into any technical  description in the abstract, but use it to motivate the work and to  highlight the importance of your project.  (target size: 15-20 lines)
